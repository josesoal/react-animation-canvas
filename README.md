# react-animation-canvas
This project was my first attempt in building something with React, maybe is not the best case to apply React, but it was a good place to start with the React Library. You can see a live demo [here](https://josesoal.github.io/react-animation-canvas/). 

This project is based in an animation of “Bouncing Balls” taken from the javascript course of [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice). 

For running the animation just download or clone the repository on Github here. Then unzip the downloaded file and follow the steps:
```
cd react-animation-canvas-master
npm install
npm start
```

There is also an article explaining this project:
