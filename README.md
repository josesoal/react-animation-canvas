# react-animation-canvas
This project was my first attempt in building something with React, maybe is not the best case to apply React, but it was a good place to start with the React Library. 

For running the animation just download or clone the repository on Github here. Them unzip the downloaded file and follow the steps:
```
cd react-animation-canvas-master
npm install
npm start
```

There is also an article explaining this project:
